# A new chapter for the Inquirer

****Philippine Daily Inquirer / 05:07 AM July 01, 2025****

The Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) was born in the dying days of a dictatorship, when journalism spelled resistance to the powerful and truth-telling carried a life-or-death price. That founding spirit endures as it takes a transformative step forward.

Beginning today, the Inquirer’s print edition will operate under the auspices of PDI’s sister company, Inquirer Interactive, merging the depth and strength of this storied broadsheet with the mobility and modernity of its digital platform, Inquirer.net.

To our readers, rest assured that this is not a departure but a renewal. What changes is the mere structure of the paper; what remains is its proud mission—of delivering “Balanced News, Fearless Views” to Filipinos wherever they are.

On Dec. 9, 1985, the Inquirer was founded by a group of intrepid journalists led by Eugenia Apostol in defiance of a regime notorious for spewing lies and twisting facts. The fledgling paper was built on the conviction that Filipinos deserve nothing less than the truth, unvarnished and unbought. Thus, the integration of PDI with Inquirer Interactive marks a reinvention and an affirmation of that legacy of credible and fearless journalism.

## Chronicler of history

From the clattering typewriters of the ’80s and ’90s to the fast-moving websites and social media networks of today, the Inquirer has served as witness and chronicler of history. Launched just months before the snap presidential elections that preceded the 1986 People Power Revolution, the Inquirer became a leading voice in the so-called mosquito press, a label it wore proudly even after it entered the mainstream. Today, it is the nation’s newspaper of record and among the country’s most influential news organizations.

This, in spite of the difficult challenges confronting the media landscape, from declining readership to the rise of disinformation and growing distrust of media due to a highly polarized political landscape, as detailed in Reuters Institute’s Digital News Report 2025.

The same report showed that PDI still enjoyed the widest reach among broadsheets with 25 percent of survey respondents reading it weekly. Notably, the paper also had the highest trust rating at 63 percent, followed by Manila Bulletin and The Philippine Star. Of 15 different media brands included in the survey, the Inquirer ranked second most trusted next to GMA Network.

On the other hand, data from web analytics firm Similarweb from January to March showed that Inquirer.net was the most visited news website in the Philippines, logging 27.35 million total visits, followed by GMA Network, ABS-CBN News, Philstar.com, and Rappler.

## Covenant with the public

Still, the Inquirer is not one to rest on its laurels. Neither has it flinched from the hard stories nor yielded to fear or favor. Its role in informing, provoking, and empowering the public is undiminished to this day, just months shy of its 40th year.

Through democratic transitions, national crises, and everyday struggles, the Inquirer has been there, its pages reflecting the stories and aspirations of a people who never stopped striving for truth and justice in a peaceful and democratic country.

This next chapter strengthens, rather than alters, that covenant with the Filipino public.

As its print and digital operations merge, the Inquirer is poised to expand its reach and meet readers across all platforms without compromising the values that shaped its legacy.

To support this transformation, several members of PDI’s editorial team are joining Inquirer Interactive’s multimedia newsroom. They have pledged their commitment to maintain uninterrupted operations while upholding the highest standards of journalism embodied in the Inquirer’s editorial policies and ethical guidelines.

## Committed to our calling

Deep down, it will be the same Inquirer that pricks at the sides of the powerful, keeping them in check or on their toes. It will be the same Inquirer that speaks for the vulnerable and educates the uninformed, while shaping public policy and spurring meaningful action for the good of our people and country.

The organization offers its deepest respect and gratitude to everyone who helped build its name and voice over the last four decades. After all, the Inquirer owes its success to the people working behind its news pages, from the top management and newsroom leaders, to reporters, editors, photographers, editorial assistants, researchers, and all the other officers and staff who play an equally important role in the publication.

To our loyal readers, subscribers, advertisers, partners, and the public at large: the Inquirer asks for your continued support, patience, and trust as it turns a new page in its history. With the same pride and principles, we remain committed to our calling: to inform, to question, to illuminate, and to tell the story of the Filipino, for all Filipinos, here and across the globe.
